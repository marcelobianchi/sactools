VISUAL:
   -correct screen resolution, now the code cat the number of screens and fix the program scren size by itself
   -magnitude position was corrected
CORRELATION:
   -was inserted a var to mark if the trace was correlated
   -if one trace has different dt the code didn't broke anymore, the correlation code skip this trace and warn how station is
   -Both size of reference trace (rt) and target trace(tt) was changed, and if the 'f' mark is set the reference to correlate window is taken
    from it and the size is defined as half of the distance to the green markers.
